<p class="frontmatter_header">About this Book - From Google to Unglue.it</p>
<p class="frontmatter_body">
This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library
shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project to make
the world&#39;s books discoverable online. It has survived long enough for the
copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain
book is one that was never subject to copyright or whose legal copyright term
has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to
country. Public domain books are our gateways to the past, representing a
wealth of history, culture and knowledge that&#39;s often difficult to discover.
Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume may appear
in this file - a reminder of this book&#39;s long journey from the publisher to a
library and finally to you.
</p>

<p class="frontmatter_body">
Google Book Search has digitized millions of physical books and made them
available online at the Google Books web site. The digitization at
the most basic level is based on page images of the
physical books. To make this book available as an ePub formatted file we have
taken those page images and extracted the text using Optical Character
Recognition (or OCR for short) technology. The extraction of text from page
images is a difficult engineering task. Smudges on the physical books&#39; pages,
fancy fonts, old fonts, torn pages, etc. can all lead to errors in the
extracted text. Imperfect OCR is only the first challenge in the ultimate goal
of moving from collections of page images to extracted-text based books. Our
computer algorithms also have to automatically determine the structure of the
book (what are the headers and footers, where images are placed, whether text
is verse or prose, and so forth). Getting this right allows presentation of the
book in a way that follows the format of the original book.

<p class="frontmatter_header">Usage guidelines </p>

<p class="frontmatter_body">
Google says they are proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain
materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong
to the public and Google are merely custodians.</p>
<p class="frontmatter_body"> Google
has taken steps to prevent abuse by commercial parties, including
placing technical restrictions on automated querying. Unglue.it has removed those technical restraints.
</p>

<p class="frontmatter_body">
We (Unglue.it) also ask that you:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="frontmatter_body"> <em>Make use of the files:</em> This work belongs to you.
</li>

<li class="frontmatter_body"> <em>Make lots of copies:</em> That way, we won't burden Google with lots of automated queries.
</li>
